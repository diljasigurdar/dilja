#If a chessboard were to have wheat placed upon each square such that one grain were placed on 
# the first square, two on the second, four on the third, and so on (doubling the number of grains 
# on each subsequent square), how many grains of wheat would be on the chessboard at the finish?

#Write a Python program using a for loop that calculates and prints out this number of grains.
